/**
 * Manages a two-level cache of RGB-to-CIELab colour conversions.
 * <p>
 * Colour conversion (RGB → CIELab) is expensive. This class avoids redundant
 * conversions through two caches:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #cache} — an instance-level cache, one per {@code ColorBase}.</li>
 * <li>{@link #convert} — a static, cross-instance cache shared by all
 * {@code ColorBase} instances in the JVM.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Lookup order when {@code add()} is called: instance cache first (early
 * return, no allocation), static cache second (LAB copied, new
 * {@code TriLabColor} registered only in instance cache), full conversion last
 * (result written to both caches). A colour that is in {@code convert} but not
 * in the current instance cache — typical for colours shared across images when
 * each image gets its own {@code ColorBase} — causes one extra
 * {@code TriLabColor} allocation per instance; this is intentional and avoids
 * cross-instance count pollution.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Internally colours are represented as {@link TriElm} triples of {@code short}
 * values. RGB components are pre-multiplied by alpha so that every stored value
 * represents what the human eye would perceive over a black background. CIELab
 * components are stored scaled by 100 and rounded to {@code short}: L* in [0,
 * 10 000], a* and b* in [−12 800, 12 800].
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The primary entry point for image analysis is the {@link ColorImage} class,
 * which reads an image file, populates a dedicated {@code ColorBase}, and
 * replaces each raw pixel value with its alpha-premultiplied absolute RGB
 * counterpart as returned by {@link #add(int)}.
 * </p>

     * colours) that single monitor became the actual bottleneck: thread dumps
     * during an 8-thread scan showed up to 7 of 8 threads simultaneously

     * utilization instead of near-800%. {@link ConcurrentSkipListMap} gives

     * {@code compareTo}) without a single choke-point lock, so {@link
