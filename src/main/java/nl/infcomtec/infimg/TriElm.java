/**
 * An ordered triple of {@code short} values used as a composite map key.
 * <p>
 * The natural ordering is lexicographic on (v0, v1, v2), which satisfies the
 * contract required by both {@link java.util.TreeMap} (the per-instance
 * cache) and {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListMap} (the shared
 * static caches in {@link ColorBase}). The meaning of v0/v1/v2 is defined by
 * the caller — {@link ColorBase} uses this both as an RGB triple (v0=R,
 * v1=G, v2=B) and, via {@link ColorBase.TriLabColor}, as a scaled CIELab
 * triple (v0=L*x100, v1=a*x100, v2=b*x100).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@code equals} and {@code hashCode} are intentionally not overridden —
 * only ordered maps that rely exclusively on {@link #compareTo} are used. Do
 * not place {@code TriElm} instances into any hash-based collection
 * ({@code HashMap}, {@code HashSet}) without first adding proper
 * {@code equals}/{@code hashCode} implementations.
